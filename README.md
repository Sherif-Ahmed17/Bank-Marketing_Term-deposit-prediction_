# Bank-Marketing_Term-deposit-prediction_
Banks spends a lot of time, money and efforts in making marketing campaigns. The goal of this campaigns is to bring new and returning customers. The dataset that we are working with is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
